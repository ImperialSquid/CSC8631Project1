# Data Understanding and Preparation Cycle 1

## Data Understanding

### Collect Initial Data
Initial data collection conssited only of downloading a zip folder of CSVs and unzipping it, along with importing the data with project template

### Describe Data
The datasets were given a quick descriptive overview in \@ref(background) but a more detailed look at the data in each is given in the table below:

## Data Preparation

### Select Data
Due to this being the inital cycle of data cleaning and preparation, no data has been excluded at this stage

### Rationale for Inclusion/Exclusion  
There is no reason to exclude data which may lead to insights, that said, as mentioned in \@ref(background) some data sets have literally no data in them, thus these data sets have been ignored and won't be imported for cleaning and analysis as they just clutter the workspace. Additionally, the sentiments dataset for session 5 has only one row in it and has thus also been excluded along the same lines.

### Clean Data
Due to this being the first round of data cleaning there were a fair few cleaning steps taken.  

The first, relatively minor, step taken was to rename the data imported from the automatic names given by ProjectTemplate to more readable names, they were renamed in the manner laid out in the table below: *\<num\> is a stand-in for the session number in the dataset name*

+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| Renamed from                                               | Renamed to           |
+============================================================+======================+
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_archetype.survey.responses        | * archetype_\<num\>  |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_enrolments                        | * enrolments_\<num\> |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_leaving.survey.responses          | * leaving_\<num\>    |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_question.response                 | * qresponses_\<num\> |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_step.activity                     | * sactivity_\<num\>  |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_team.members                      | * members_\<num\>    |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_video.stats                       | * vidstats_\<num\>   |
| * cyber.security.\<num\>_weekly.sentiment.survey.responses | * sentiments_\<num\> |
+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

Next up was cleaning the data types of the columns in the data frames. The first of these was to entries into proper NA values rather than an empty string or "unknown", etc.  

The second area of cleaning was the datetime columns that appear in many of the datasets, these were all in string form which makes mathematical procedures on such data impossible, thus they were turned in a POSIXct type, which stores the datetime as seconds from 00:00 01/01/1970.

``` {r}
str_datetime = "2017-10-04 09:23:14 UTC"
typeof(str_datetime)
posixct_datetime = as.POSIXct(str_datetime, format = "%F %T UTC", tz = "GMT")
typeof(posixct_datetime)
```

Unfortunately, `as.POSIXct()` is not a vectorised function and so the conversions must be done one by one, additionally there are a lot of such conversions that need doing if it is to be done to all the datasets so this munge file was commented out after being made until the datasets being considered were reduced.

The next item for cleaning were any columns with category factors, eg, the reason for leaving is one of 8 possible options that are consistent across all the sessions. (The opportunity was also taken to correct an encoding error where an apostrophe was encoded as "â€™").



## Data Understanding and Preparation Cycle Summary

### Summary of Work Done
A lot of work was done in this cycle both with regards to exploring the data and cleaning it for future analysis. After doing all this, it was decided that the `learner-id` column was pivotal with regards to linking between datasets. 


### Future Plans {#futurePlans1}
After the exploration done it was decided that the most interesting avenue would be to explore how a factor like gender affected people scores on the quiz questions, the main datasets involved in this investigation would be the `enrolments` datasets as they hold information about the participants, the other would be the `quiz responses` datasets as they hold information on the participant performance. The main challenge in combining these data sets would be to see how effectively the `learner-id` columns could be mapped onto each other.
